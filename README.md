# Underwater-Debris-Detection
ML model for detecting debris present underwater using SIFT feature extractor and implementing classifiers as Random forest, Decision tree and SVM

The project's aim was to build a system to detect or predict river debris using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a substantial dataset and employing the SIFT algorithm for feature extraction, the research showcases the proficiency of SVM, RF and DT classifiers. Precision, accuracy, and F1-score metrics, along with confusion matrices, provide comprehensive insights into classifier performance. These findings significantly contribute to the advancement of automated debris detection and environmental monitoring, with potential applications in disaster management and remote sensing
